# Chessperiment

> Chessperiment is a web-based sandbox for designing, experimenting with, and playing custom chess variants.  
> It focuses on flexible board layouts, customizable pieces, and rule experimentation rather than standard chess play.

## Core Capabilities

- Custom Variant Design  
  Chessperiment allows users to create their own chess variants by defining board layouts, starting positions, pieces, and movement rules.

- Custom Piece Definitions  
  Pieces can be configured with non-standard movement patterns, including directional moves, jumps, and board-dependent behavior.

- Flexible Board Layouts  
  Boards are not limited to the classic 8×8 grid. Chessperiment supports custom sizes and alternative board geometries, including experimental layouts.

- Rule Experimentation  
  The platform is designed to explore alternative rulesets and mechanics beyond orthodox chess, with an emphasis on prototyping and iteration.

- Variant Sharing  
  Created variants can be saved and shared so others can explore and test custom designs.

## Technical Notes

- Data Model  
  Variants are represented using structured, machine-readable configurations (e.g. JSON-style rule definitions).

- Engine Scope  
  Chessperiment uses a custom rule interpreter focused on validating moves and rules defined by the user.  
  It is not a traditional chess engine and does not rely on standard chess libraries.

- Platform  
  Runs entirely in the browser and is intended for experimentation, editing, and play within a web environment.

## Intended Use

Chessperiment is aimed at:
- experimenting with chess mechanics  
- designing custom boards and pieces  
- exploring non-standard variants  
- learning and prototyping abstract strategy games inspired by chess

It is not limited to competitive play and is not focused on classical chess optimization.
