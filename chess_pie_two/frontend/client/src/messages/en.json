                "a1": "The Piece Editor allows you to design the visual appearance and the movement logic of your custom chess pieces. It consists of a Pixel Editor (64x64) and two logic editors: the Visual Move Editor for geometric constraints and the Visual Logic Editor (Block Editor) for event-driven behavior.",
                "q2": "What are Vector Constraints?",
                "a2": "Instead of fixed patterns, the engine uses geometric vectors. A move is defined by its displacement in X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) directions. This allows for flexible definitions like 'any distance on the diagonal' or 'exactly 2 squares horizontally'."

                "a1": "You define rules using variables: diffX (horizontal step), diffY (vertical step), absDiffX (absolute horizontal distance), and absDiffY (absolute vertical distance). If a move matches your conditions, it is marked as 'Allow' (legal) or 'Disallow' (illegal).",
                "q2": "What is the difference between sliding and jumping?",
                "a2": "Currently, custom moves are 'Teleport' based by default. If you define a rule for a target square, the piece jumps there. Future updates will introduce 'Collision' properties to toggle sliding behavior (where intermediate squares must be empty)."

                "a1": "Triggers are the starting points of your logic chains (e.g., 'onCapture', 'onMove', 'onCaptured'). They fire when a specific event occurs. You must snap Effect blocks to these Triggers to make them execute.",
                "q2": "What is 'Prevent Default'?",
                "a2": "The 'Prevent Default' block is a powerful terminal that stops the engine from performing its standard action. For example, placing it inside 'onCaptured' makes the piece invincible because the capture event is canceled.",
                "q3": "Can I transform pieces?",
                "a3": "Yes. Using the 'Transformation' block, you can turn a piece into another type. This is commonly used for pawn promotion or special 'Phoenix' pieces that transform instead of dying.",
                "q4": "How do variables work?",
                "a4": "You can use the 'Modify Var' block to increment or decrement numeric values (like 'Health' or 'Rage stacks'). You can then use the 'onVar' trigger to react when a variable reaches a certain threshold."

                "a1": "Ensure that your blocks are physically snapped together. Floating blocks will not execute. Also, check the trigger context: 'onCapture' fires *during* the capture, while 'onMove' fires *after* the board has already updated.",
                "q2": "Does 'Prevent Default' work on 'onThreat'?",
                "a2": "No. 'onThreat' is a passive check used for highlighting. You cannot 'prevent' a threat; you can only prevent the move or capture that causes it."
