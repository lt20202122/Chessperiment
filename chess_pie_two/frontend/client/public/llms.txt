# Chessperiment

> **Chessperiment** is a generative framework for highly custom chess variants.
> High-signal documentation for AI coding agents: [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt)

## Tool Calling & Navigation

*   **Full Technical Docs**: [/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) (Token Count: ~2k)
    *   *Contains*: Logic Manifesto, API Schemas, Block Editor Reference, Move Rule Cookbook.
*   **Live Editor**: [chessperiment.app/editor](https://chessperiment.app/editor)

## Capabilities Summary

*   **Logic Engine**: Vector-based move constraints (`diffX`, `diffY`) instead of static patterns to support arbitrarily sized boards.
*   **Event System**: Scratch-like block editor for reactive logic (`onCapture`, `Transformation`).
*   **Rendering**: Frontend-agnostic piece rendering (PNG/SVG) with visual feedback.
*   **Infrastructure**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Firebase (Store), Socket.io (Realtime), Redis (Cache).

## Features
 
* Hexagon Squares
* Custom board shapes: Holes, disabled squares etc.
* Pixel Art for Piece Design (within the browser)
* Engine to play against
* Piece Editor with trigger (onMove, onIsThreatend etc.) --> effects (transform, ModVar, kill etc.)
* Variables for pieces (e.g. lives)
