# TODO

## Marketplace (!DONT DO THAT YET, THE IDEA IS NOT FINISHED, IGNORE THIS PARAGRAPH!)

- [x] Add a Marketplace for Boards, Pieces and Designs. Some should be free, but also create a buying mockup.
- [ ] Add a way to rate and review the boards, pieces and designs. You should be able to see the average rating and the number of reviews, as well as the reviews of other users.
- [ ] Add a way to search for boards, pieces and designs.
- [ ] Add a way to sort the boards, pieces and designs by rating, number of reviews, price, etc.
- [ ] Add a way to filter the boards, pieces and designs by category, price, etc.
- [ ] Add everything to the database.
- [ ] You should only be able to buy boards, pieces and designs if you are logged in.
- [ ] You should be able to see your purchases in your profile.
- [ ] You should be able to sell your boards, pieces and designs.
- [ ] Take a look at the figma screenshot for the idea and layout.

Playing does not work yet, so both players are apparently white. And nobody can play, so you can't drag the pieces. I also don't know why there is a practice vs. computer link right while you play. I don't think that this link makes sense; please remove it.

In /editor/board, The left and top handlers still don't really work. I've sent you a video of me trying to pull the left handle. You see it's super laggy.

# Backlog (dont do these!)

## Report
