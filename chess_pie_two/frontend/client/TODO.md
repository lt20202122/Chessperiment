# TODO

## Piece Editor
- [ ] Implement save to database, see PieceEditorSidebar.tsx, Line 19!

## History Mode
- [ ] Often, the History Mode just doesn't work, jumping right to the first move.
- [ ] Add move highlighting in History Mode.

## Responsiveness
- [ ] Make homepage responsive for all screen sizes (the desktop version is the only one that works).
- [ ] Make /game responsive for all screen sizes (the desktop version is the only one that works). The board should have some margin, and right now, it's almost cut-off, only if you scroll down, zoom out and scroll back up, it fits.
- [ ] Make /editor responsive for all screen sizes (the desktop version is the only one that works). I mean /editor/board and /editor/piece.

## Effects
- [ ] On win / loss / draw, show some really cool Effect as Feedback over the board.
- [ ] on Mobile Mode, you basically never know when for example a checkmate happens, or your opp offered a draw, because you'd have to scroll down to see that.

## Chat
- [ ] Add an Ingame-Chat.
- [ ] Add some kind of security to the chat, so that no one can spam the chat or write something offensive.

## Marketplace (!DONT DO THAT YET, THE IDEA IS NOT FINISHED, IGNORE THIS PARAGRAPH!)
- [ ] Add a Marketplace for Boards, Pieces and Designs. Some should be free, but also create a buying mockup. 
- [ ] Add a way to rate and review the boards, pieces and designs. You should be able to see the average rating and the number of reviews, as well as the reviews of other users.
- [ ] Add a way to search for boards, pieces and designs.
- [ ] Add a way to sort the boards, pieces and designs by rating, number of reviews, price, etc.
- [ ] Add a way to filter the boards, pieces and designs by category, price, etc.
- [ ] Add everything to the database.
- [ ] You should only be able to buy boards, pieces and designs if you are logged in.
- [ ] You should be able to see your purchases in your profile.
- [ ] You should be able to sell your boards, pieces and designs.
- [ ] Take a look at the figma screenshot for the idea and layout.

## Random
- [ ] Make the color selection random when starting a new game.
