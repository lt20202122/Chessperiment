Final review and refinements completed.
1. Verified SEO status (Meta tags and H1s are present).
2. Refined `PlayBoard.tsx` logic:
   - Fixed spectator color bug (was defaulting to black).
   - Implemented history replay for custom games to ensure board state is synchronized when joining/rejoining.
   - Ensured robustness of online play without local project access.
All tasks from TODO list are completed and verified.
